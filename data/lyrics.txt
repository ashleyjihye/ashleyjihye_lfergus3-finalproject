i heard that youre set tled down that you found a boy and youre mar ried now 
i heard that your dreams came true guess he gave you things i did nt give to you 
old friend why are you so shy aint like you to hold back or hide from the light 
i hate to turn up out of the blue un in vit ed but i could nt stay a way i could nt fight it
