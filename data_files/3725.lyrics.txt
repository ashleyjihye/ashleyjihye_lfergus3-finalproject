13	3	1	nal
14	1	1	cur
15	3	1	tain.
16	0	1	My
17	0	1	friend
18	0	1	I

26	0	1	of
27	0	1	which
28	0	1	I'm
29	1	1	cer
30	3	1	tain.
31	0	1	I've
32	0	1	lived
33	0	1	a
34	0	1	life
35	0	1	that's
36	0	1	full
37	0	1	I've
38	1	1	trav
39	3	1	eled
40	0	1	each
41	0	1	and
42	1	1	ev'
43	3	1	ry
44	1	1	high
45	3	1	way
46	0	1	and
47	0	1	more
48	0	1	much
49	0	1	more
50	0	1	than
51	0	1	this.
52	0	1	I
53	0	1	did
54	0	1	it
55	0	1	my
56	0	1	way.
57	0	1	Yes

64	0	1	knew,
65	0	1	when
66	0	1	I
67	0	1	bit
68	0	1	off
69	0	1	more
70	0	1	than
71	0	1	I
72	0	1	could
73	0	1	chew.
74	0	1	But
75	0	1	thru
76	0	1	it
77	0	1	all
78	0	1	when
79	0	1	there
80	0	1	was
81	0	1	doubt
82	0	1	I
83	0	1	ate
84	0	1	it
85	0	1	up
86	0	1	and
87	0	1	spit
88	0	1	it
89	0	1	out.
90	0	1	I
91	0	1	faced
92	0	1	it
93	0	1	all
94	0	1	and
95	0	1	I
96	0	1	stood
97	0	1	tall
98	0	1	and
99	0	1	did
100	0	1	it
101	0	1	my
102	0	1	way.
103	0	1	I've
104	0	2	loved,
105	0	2	I've
106	0	2	laughed
107	0	2	and
108	0	2	cried.
109	0	2	I've
110	0	2	had
111	0	2	my
112	0	2	fill
113	0	2	my
114	0	2	share
115	0	2	of
116	1	2	lo
117	3	2	sing.
118	0	2	And
119	0	2	now
120	0	2	as
121	0	2	tears
122	1	2	sub
123	3	2	side
124	0	2	I
125	0	2	find
126	0	2	it
127	0	2	all
129	0	2	so
130	1	2	a
131	2	2	mus
132	3	2	ing.
133	0	2	To
134	0	2	think
135	0	2	I
136	0	2	did
137	0	2	all
138	0	2	that
139	0	2	and
140	0	2	may
141	0	2	I
142	0	2	say
143	0	2	not
144	0	2	in
145	0	2	a
146	0	2	shy
147	0	2	way.
148	0	2	Oh
149	0	2	no
150	0	2	Oh
151	0	2	no
152	0	2	not
153	0	2	me.
154	0	2	I
155	0	2	did
156	0	2	it
157	0	2	my
158	0	2	way.
159	0	2	What
160	0	2	is
161	0	2	a
162	0	2	man?
163	0	2	What
164	0	2	has
165	0	2	he
166	0	2	got?
167	0	2	If
168	0	2	not
169	1	2	him
170	3	2	self
172	0	2	then
173	0	2	he
174	0	2	has
175	0	2	not.
176	0	2	To
177	0	2	say
178	0	2	the
179	0	2	things
180	0	2	he
181	1	2	tru
182	3	2	ly
183	0	2	feels
184	0	2	and
185	0	2	not
186	0	2	the
187	0	2	words
188	0	2	of
189	0	2	one
190	0	2	who
191	0	2	kneels.
192	0	2	The
193	1	2	rec
194	3	2	ord
195	0	2	shows
196	0	2	I
197	0	2	took
198	0	2	the
199	0	2	blows
200	0	2	and
201	0	2	did
202	0	2	it
204	0	2	way.
